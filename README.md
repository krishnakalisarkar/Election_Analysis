## Overview of Election Audit:

### Purpose of this election audit analysis:

An election audit is any review conducted after polls close for the purpose of determining whether the votes were counted accurately (a results audit) or whether proper procedures were followed (a process audit), or both.For better quality management these audits must be completed before election results are declared.
The purpose of this audit is to review the Colorado state county election and help the election commission with data that clearly shows the statistics of county and winning candidate.

### Election-Audit Results: 

A csv file with complete election data was provided to me. I opened the csv file and after reading the file, I ran some codes in python through the VS Code editor and came up to some conclusions regarding the election results. The results are as follows.

1. **How many votes were cast in this congressional election?**

   A total of **368,711 votes** were casted in three counties namely Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe.

2. **Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.**

  There are three counties mainly Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe. The breakdown of votes in percentage and total votes is as follows:

  **County Votes:
  Jefferson received 10.5% of votes and it received a total of 38,855 votes.
  Denver received 82.8% of votes and it received a total of 306,055 votes.
  Arapahoe received 6.7% of votes and it received a total of 11,606 votes.

3. **Which county had the largest number of votes?**

  The county to receive the largest number of votes is **Denver** with a total of 306,055 votes, which is 82.8% of the total votes.

4. **Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received**

  There were a total of 3 candidates in this election namely Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane. A detailed breakdown of their votes is   as follows.

  **Charles Casper Stockham** got 23% of the total votes with a total number of 85,213 votes.
  **Diana DeGette** got 73% of the total votes with a total number of 272,892 votes and 
  **Raymon Anthony Doane** got 3.1% of the total votes with a total number of 11,606 votes.


**Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?**
From the above data it is clear that the undisputed winner of this election is **Diana DeGette with a total winning vote count of 272,892 and a winning percentage of 73.8%.

## Election-Audit Summary:

To summarize this audit, the code clearly extracted the information needed from the huge data set, proving valuable information on the total votes, candidates their winning percentage and county votes. It can be concluded that the code that is used to open, write, save and analyze the election data is fairly flexible and can be used to serve many other functions. 

** Other uses of this code.**

* By changing the variable name it can be used as a versatile code for elections in other states with different counties and candidates.
* By modifying the basic code, polling fraud can be detected, where if a voter with a Ballot ID casts more than one vote then only one vote will be counted 		   and the other votes will be ignored.
